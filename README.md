Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I was given boilerplate fode for the pirate treasure maze .ipynb file, and I had to implement the Deep Q-Learning alogrithm

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
-The role of a computer scientist is to design and implement software systems and algorithms that solve real world problems for users and organizations. Computer scientists work matters because it drives innovation in society and in nearly all industries

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
-The best approach for problem solving as a computer scientist is to break the problem down into more managable parts, and them apply logic into finding effective solutions.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
-A computer scientist must create solutions that are secure while maintiaining high fidelity, and also meet the goals of the end user.
